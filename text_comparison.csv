==================
   RADIOLOGY
==================

CT scan C spine [**2162-3-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Fracture of the C6 as described involving the right pedicle
(extending to the inferior facet) and left lamina. Anterior
widening at the C6-7 disc space and mild widening of left C6-7
facet also noted. Prevertebral hematoma at C6 with likely
rupture of the anterior longitudinal ligament.

2.  Lucency in the right posterior C1 ring may represent a
chronic injury.
Likely old avulsion fracture at T2 pedicle on the left.

3. Ossification of both anterior and posterior longitudinal
ligaments with
compromise of the central spinal canal. Degenerative disease is
further
described above.

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS ([**2162-3-3**])
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute injuries in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
2. Three discrete pleural fluid collections in the right
hemithorax, likely pseudotumors.
3. Small hypodense lesion in the pancreatic body is of unclear
etiology, may represent pseudicyst or cystic tumor. Further
evaluation with MRI may be performed on a non- emergent basis.
4. Bilateral renal cysts.
5. Foley catheter balloon inflated within the prostatic urethra.
Recommend emergent repositioning.

CT SINUS/MAXILLOFACIAL ([**2162-3-3**])
1. Bilateral nasal bone fractures.
2. Left frontal scalp hematoma with preseptal soft tissue
swelling. Question foreign body anterior to the left globe.
Recommend clinical correlation. Small amount of extraconal
hematoma in the superior aspect of the left orbit.
3. Linear lucency in the right posterior ring of C1. Correlate
with CT C- spine performed concurrently.

HEAD CT ([**2162-3-3**])
1. No acute intracranial hemprrhage.
2. Left frontal scalp hematoma.
3. Nasal bone fractures. Recommend correlation with report from
facial bone CT scan.
4. Lucency in the right posterior ring of C1. Please refer to
dedeicated CT C-spine for further detail.
5. Left cerebellar encephalomalacia, likely due to old
infarction.

CHEST [**2162-3-10**]
The Dobbhoff tube passes below the diaphragm with its tip most
likely terminating in the stomach. The bilateral pacemakers are
demonstrated with one lead terminating in right atrium and three
leads terminating in right ventricle. The patient is in mild
pulmonary edema with no change in the loculated pleural fluid
within the major fissure.

CT HEAD [**2162-3-11**]
1. A tiny amount of intraventricular hemorrhage layers along the
occipital horns of the ventricles bilaterally. Recommend followp
imaging.
2. Left frontal scalp hematoma has decreased in size.
3. Unchanged left cerebellar encephalomalacia.
4. Nasal bone fractures are better evaluated on dedicated
maxillofacial CT.

RIGHT SHOULDER X-RAY ([**2162-3-11**])
Mild glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis.
Nonspecific ossification projecting over the upper margin of the
scapular body and adjacent to the lesser tuberosity. Diagnostic
considerations include the sequela of chronic calcific bursitis,
intraarticular bodies, and/or calcific tendinitis of the
subscapularis tendon.
Increased opacity projecting over the right hemithorax and minor
fissure, better delineated on recent chest radiographs and chest
CT

RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND ([**2162-3-13**])
1. Deep venous thrombosis in the right axillary vein, extending
proximally into the right subclavian vein, and distally to
involve the brachial veins, portion of the basilic vein, and the
right cephalic vein.
2. Likely 2.0 cm left axillary lymph node, with unusual
son[**Name (NI) 493**] features somewhat suspicious for malignancy.
Followup ultrasound is recommended in 4 weeks, and FNA/biopsy
may be considered at that time if no interval improvement.

[**2162-3-14**]
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There are small-to-moderate
bilateral pleural effusions, on the right with a loculated
appearance. There is associated compressive atelectasis. The
visualized portion of the heart suggests mild cardiomegaly.
There is no pericardial effusion. There is a 9-mm
hypoattenuating, well-defined lesion in the left lobe of the
liver (2:12) too small to accurately characterize but
statistically most likely representing a cyst. There are
bilateral, partially exophytic renal cysts. The spleen is normal
in size. There is a 5-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreatic
body, most likely representing focal fat. The gallbladder and
adrenal glands are unremarkable. An NG tube terminates in the
stomach. There is no ascites. The large and small bowel loops
appear unremarkable without wall thickening or pneumatosis. Oral
contrast material has passed into the ascending colon without
evidence of obstruction. There is no ascites and no free air.
There is a small pocket of air in the left rectus muscle,
tracking over a distance of approximately 10 cm.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The pelvic small and large bowel
loops, collapsed bladder containing Foley catheter and seminal
vesicles appear unremarkable. The prostate is enlarged,
measuring 5.9 cm in transverse diameter. The rectum contains a
moderate amount of dried stool. There is no free air or free
fluid.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There is
DISH of the entire visualized thoracolumbar spine. There also
are degenerative changes about the hip joints with large
acetabular osteophytes.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable bilateral pleural effusions, loculated on the right.
2. New focus of air tracking within the left rectus muscle with
associated tiny amount of extraperitoneal air (2:53). No
associated stranding or fluid collection. Please correlate
clinically if this could be iatrogenic, such as due to s.q.
injections.
3. 5-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreatic body. This could
represent focal fat, although a cystic tumor cannot be excluded.
If this is of concern, then MRI is again recommended for further
evaluation.
4. Hypoattenuating focus in the left lobe of the liver, too
small to accurately characterize.
5. Bilateral partially exophytic renal cysts.
6. Moderate amount of dried stool within the rectum.

A wet read was placed and the pertinent findings were discussed
by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1831**] [**Name (STitle) 1832**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1833**] at 11:30 p.m. on [**2162-3-14**].

[**2162-3-16**]
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW FINDINGS: Real-time video
fluoroscopic evaluation was performed after oral administration
of thin and puree consistency of barium, in conjunction with the
speech pathologist.

ORAL PHASE: Normal bolus formation, bolus control, AP tongue
movement, oral transit time, and no oral cavity residue.

PHARYNGEAL PHASE: There is normal swallow initiation and velar
elevation. There is mild-to-moderate impairment of laryngeal
elevation with absent epiglottic deflection. There is
moderate-to-severe increase in pharyngeal transit time. There is
residue in the valleculae and piriform sinuses with moderate
impairment of bolus propulsion. There was aspiration of both
thin and puree barium.

IMPRESSION: Aspiration of thin liquids and puree. For additional
information, please see the speech and swallow therapist's
report from the same day.

[**2162-3-18**] CT Head w/out:
FINDINGS: There is a small amount of blood layering in the
occipital horns of both lateral ventricles, unchanged though not
as dense given evolution. No new hemorrhage is identified. The
ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are enlarged secondary to
involutional change. Periventricular white matter hyperdensities
are sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemia. Encephalomalacia
in the left cerebellar hemisphere secondary to old infarction is
unchanged. The osseous structures are unremarkable. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
Skin staples are noted along the superior- posterior neck
secondary to recent spinal surgery.

IMPRESSION: No interval change with a very small
intraventricular hemorrhage.

No discharge labs as patient CMO.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1829**] was seen at [**Hospital1 18**] after his fall from a height
of approximatly 10 feet.  CT scans of his chest, abdomen and
pelvis were negative for pathology.  CT scan of his C-spine
showed fracture of anterior and posterior elements at C6-7.  He
was also shown to have a right nasal bone fracture.

C-spine fracture: Mr. [**Known lastname 1829**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] two surgical
procedures to stabilized his c-spine.  [**2162-3-4**]: anterior
cervical decompression/fusion at C6-7.  [**2162-3-5**]: Cervical
laminectomy C6-C7 & T1 with Posterior cervical arthrodesis
C4-T1.  He tolerated the procedures well.  He was extubated
without complication.

After his surgical procedures, Mr. [**Known lastname 1829**] was transfered
to the medicine service at [**Hospital1 18**] for his medical care. While on
the medicine service, patient was found to be persistently
aspirating and failed his speech and swallow evaluation. Patient
and family were not interested in an NG tube or PEG for
nutrition. Patient also developed a venous clot of the right
upper extremity and the decision was made to not proceed with
medical treatment. Goals of care were changed to comfort
measures only. A foley was placed after patient had difficulty
with urinary retention and straight cathing. A palliative care
consult was obtained for symptom management and patient was
discharged to hospice with morphine, olanzapine, and a foley in
place for symptomatic relief.

Chief Complaint:
left sided brain lesion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2-25**] Left Craniotomy for mass resection


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 1852**] is a 62-year-old left-handed man who is here for a
follow up of his left sphenoid meningioma.  I last saw him on
[**2149-11-17**] and his head CT showed growth of the left sphenoid
meningioma.  He is seizure free.  Today, he is here with his
wife
and daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] does not have headache, nausea, vomiting,
urinary incontinence, or fall.

His neurological problem began on [**2142-6-22**] when he became
confused and disoriented in a hotel bathroom.  At that time, he
was visiting his daughter for a wedding.  His wife found him
slumped over in the bath tube.  According to her, his eyes
looked
funny.  He could not stand up.  His verbal output did not make
sense.  He was brought to [**Doctor First Name 1853**] Hospital in Placentia,
CA.  He woke up 7 to 8 hours later in the emergency room.  He
felt very tired after the event.  He was hospitalized from
[**2142-6-22**] to [**2142-6-25**].  He had a cardiac pacemaker placement due
to irregular heart rate and bradycardia.  He also had a head MRI
that showed a less than 1 cm diameter sphenoid meningioma.


Past Medical History:
Cardiac arrhythmia as noted above, has a
pacemaker in place, prostate cancer with prostatectomy, and
hypertension.


Social History:
Lives with his wife.  Retired, works parttime
driving a school bus.


Family History:
NC

Physical Exam:
Temperature is 97.8 F.  His blood pressure
is 150/92.  Pulse is 80.  Respiration is 16.  His skin
has full turgor.  HEENT is unremarkable.  Neck is supple.
Cardiac examination reveals regular rate and rhythms.  His lungs
are clear.  His abdomen is soft with good bowel sounds.  His
extremities do not show clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

Neurological Examination:  His Karnofsky Performance Score is
100.  He is awake, alert, and oriented times 3.  There His
language is fluent with good comprehension.  His recent recall
is
intact.  Cranial Nerve Examination:  His pupils are equal and
reactive to light, 4 mm to 2 mm bilaterally.  Extraocular
movements are full.  There is no nystagmus.  Visual fields are
full to confrontation.  Funduscopic examination reveals sharp
disks margins bilaterally.  His face is symmetric.  Facial
sensation is intact bilaterally.  His hearing is intact
bilaterally.  His tongue is midline.  Palate goes up in the
midline.  Sternocleidomastoids and upper trapezius are strong.
Motor Examination:  He does not have a drift.  His muscle
strengths are [**5-16**] at all muscle groups.  His muscle tone is
normal.  His reflexes are 0 in upper and lower extremities
bilaterally.  His ankle jerks are absent.  His toes are
down going.  Sensory examination is intact to touch and
proprioception.  Coordination examination does not reveal
dysmetria.  His gait is normal.  He can do tandem.  He does not
have a Romberg.

PHYSICAL EXAM UPON DISCHARGE:
non focal
incision c/d/i, dissolvable sutures

Pertinent Results:
[**2-25**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:
1. Likely meningioma along the greater [**Doctor First Name 362**] of the left sphenoid
bone,
measuring 18 mm in diameter, unchanged since the most recent
study of [**11/2149**], with reactive bony changes, as above.
2. Bifrontal cortical atrophy, which has progressed slightly
over the series of studies since the earliest studies of [**2142**].

[**2-25**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:
Expected post-operative changes with the left frontal craniotomy
including
subcutaneous air and soft tissue swelling, moderate
pneumocephalus overlying predominantly the bilateral frontal
lobes, and foci of hemorrhage in the surgical bed. No evidence
of residual tumor on this non contrast CT.

[**2-26**] CXR: FINDINGS: The lung volumes are rather low. There is
moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of overt pulmonary edema.
No areas of atelectasis or pneumonia. Right pectoral pacemaker
in situ, with correct lead placement.


[**2-28**] Head CT /c contrast: IMPRESSION: Status post left frontal
craniotomy changes with improvement of pneumocephalus and stable
3 mm left to right midline shift; focus of hemorrhage
with/without residual tumor in the resection bed is similar in
appearance to prior exam but now with more surrounding vasogenic
edema. Stable appearance of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Followup to
assess for residual tumor/ interval change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented electively on [**2-25**] for left sided craniotomy
for mass resection. he tolerated the procedure well and was
taken to the Trauma ICU post-operatively still intubated.
Shortly thereafter he was deemed fit for extubation which was
done without difficulty. At post-op check he was neurologically
intact.
On [**2-26**] he was neurologically intact and cleared for transfer to
the stepdown unit. This did not happen due to bed shortage. A CT
with contrast was ordered for post op evaluation.
On [**2-27**] he was again stable and cleared for transfer to the
floor. Decadron taper was initiated. He was seen by PT and
cleared for discharge home.
On [**2-28**] the patient was being prepped for discharge but was

Chief Complaint:
Xanax, Tylenol & Klonopin Overdose

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
37 yo F with history of depression and suicidal attempt in the
past presented with obtundation.  Of note, her prior attempt was
about 15 years ago during which she OD on theophylline,
requiring intubation.  She has been feeling more depressed over
the last few months and has been seeing a therapist, on the ECT
waiting list with recent evaluation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2109**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] her
partner.  [**Name (NI) **] reports taking 120 mg of Xanax and 80 mg
Klonopin in the afternoon of [**2101-10-25**] as well as at least [**4-7**]
g of Tylenol daily over the last 2 weeks.  She also admitted to
taking 20 mg of Ambien.  She says that she was taking the
tylenol intentionally to worsen her liver function.  She says
that she decided to do this because she wanted to commit
suicide.  She also reports having had 1 glass of wine on the day
of these medication ingestions.  She then called one of her
friends afterwards, and her therapist ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2110**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) was
subsequently involved and called the EMS for patient.

In the ED, her initial VS were HR 99, BP 102/56, RR 20, and 98%
on RA.  She arrived with her friend, very lethargic.  Per
report, was only responsive to sternal rub and GCS of 8
throughout.  Tox screen showed positive benzos and acetaminophen
only.  ECG showed sinus tachycardia.  UA was negative.  CT head
did not show ICH.  Her initial Tylenol level was 40.  Toxicology
was consulted and recommended NAC for 21 hours until level is
undetectable and LFT stabilizes.  She started NAC in the ED and
her repeat level was 29.  VS prior to transfer were T95, HR 66,
BP 121/73, RR 22, O2Sat 98% RA.

She was transferred to the ICU for her poor mental status.
While on the floor, appears comfortable, denies any SOB, chest
pain/discomfort, abdominal pain/discomfort, urinary symptoms or

discomfort when swallowing.  Her partner reports that patient's
mental status seems to have improved since her initial arrival
to the ED.

Pertinent Results:
[**2148-2-3**]:
TRAUMA #3 (PORT CHEST ONLY):
IMPRESSION: Known right-sided pneumothorax seen on subsequent
chest CT is not clearly visualized on the current radiograph.
Fractures of the right
posterior 11th and 12th ribs.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1. Grade 3 liver laceration involving segment VII and
hemoperitoneum, without
evidence of active extravasation.
2. Small right pneumothorax.
3. 11 and 12 right rib fractures.
4. Right transverse process fractures of L2 and L3.
5. Left sacral alar and left superior pubic ramus fractures

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of C-spine fracture or subluxation.
2. Tiny right apical pneumothorax.
3. Sclerotic focus in the right C7 pedicle. While this may
represent a bone island, please correlate with any prior history
of malignancy and consider a bone scan for further evaluation.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process

FEMUR (AP & LAT) RIGHT:
IMPRESSION: No fracture or dislocation

[**2148-2-4**]:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP):
The NG tube tip is in the stomach. Right apical pneumothorax is
noted, small  unchaged since the prior CT torso (within the
limitations of comparison between different modalities). Heart
size and mediastinum are unremarkable. Bibasal atelectasis is
noted. No appreciable pleural effusion is seen.  Bilateral
breast prostheses are noted.

[**2147-2-5**]:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP):
Small right apical pneumothorax is decreasing. New opacification
at the
periphery of the left lung is due at least in part to breast
prosthesis.
There could be a new small left pleural effusion or even
consolidation.
Followup advised. Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. No right
pleural
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2190**] was admitted under the acute care surgery service on
[**2148-2-3**] for further evaluation and management of her injuries.
She was initially admitted to the trauma ICU for close
monitoring given her rib fractures, and was transferred to the
floor on HD#1 as she remained stable.

Neuro: She remained alert and oriented throughout her
hospitalization. Her pain level was routinely assessed. She was
initially administered IV narcotics for pain control, and was
transitioned to an oral regimen when tolerating PO's. Prior to
discharge, she reported adequate pain control on an oral
regimen.

CV: Her vital signs were monitored routinely and she remained
afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Serial hct's were checked
given her liver lac, initially q6h on admission and then [**Hospital1 **].
They remained stable, and she remained without evidence of blood
loss.

Pulm: Given the small size of her pneumothorax, no chest tube
placement was necessary. Agressive pulmonary toileting and
incentive spirometry were encouraged. Nebulizer treatments were
administered. Her supplemental oxygen was able to be weaned.
Prior to discharge, her oxygen saturation was within normal
limits on room air. She remained without respiratory compromise.

GI: She was initially kept NPO with IV fluids for hydration and
an NG tube was placed on admission given her liver laceration.
Her hematocrit remained stable and abdominal exam remained
benign, so the NG tube was removed on [**2-4**] and she was started on
clear liquids. Her diet was slowly advanced over the next 24
hours and she was tolerating a regular diet at discharge. She
was started on a bowel regimen given her narcotic intake.

GU: A foley catheter was placed on admission. Her intake and
output were closely monitored. On [**2-5**] it was removed and she
voided without difficulty.

Musk: Orthopedics was consulted given her pelvic fractures and
lumbar transverse process fractures. These injuries were
determined to be stable requiring no surgical intervention.
Follow up in the orthopedic clinic was scheduled for 2 weeks
from discharge.

Physical therapy was consulted to evaluate her mobility, given
her injuries determined she was best suited going to rehab. The
patient was discharged to rehab in stable condition, pain
controlled on oral medication, tolerating a regular diet, and
urinating without difficulty.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after being struck by a motor
vehicle.  As a result of this accident you sustained multiple
injuries as listed below.

Your multiple rib fractures can cause severe pain and
subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the
pain.

*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay
ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep
breaths. If the pain medication is too sedating take half the
dose and notify your physician.

*  Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that
pool in the lungs.

*  You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to
hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing
and deep breathing.

*  Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short
periods may ease the pain.

*  Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid
and fiber intake if possible.

*  Do NOT smoke

*  If your doctor allows, non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin,
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side
effects so make sure your doctor approves.

*  Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation
around your ribs ( crepitus ).

Pertinent Results:
Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**4-/2174**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Limited coronary angiography demonstrated heavily calcified
left
main, left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries. The
left circumflex had a heavily calcified proximal lesion.
2. LV ventriculography was deferred.
3. Successful Rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the
proximal left circumflex artery with a Cypher (3x13mm) drug
eluting stent postdilated to 3.5mm. Final angiography
demonstrated no
angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and
TIMI III flow throughout the vessel (See PTCA Comments).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the
proximal LCX with a drug eluting stent (Cypher).
.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2174-5-20**] demonstrated:The left
atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and moderate global hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.7cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a very small circumferential pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis. Moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate global hypokinesis.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

EKG on admission-Sinus tachycardia with left bundle-branch block
with secondary ST-T wave
abnormalities. No diagnostic change from tracing #1.
.
[**Month/Day/Year **] on admission - The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with near akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral
walls and mild-moderate hypokinesis of the remaining segments
(LVEF = 30-35%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is moderate to severe aortic valve
stenosis (area 0.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At least mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small, primarily anterior (?loculated)
pericardial effusion without evidence of hemodynamic compromise
with a prominent anterior fat pad.
.
[**6-6**] EKG - Sinus tachycardia. Left atrial abnormality. Left
bundle-branch block.
Left axis deviation. Secondary repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2174-6-4**] heart rate has increased. Otherwise,
no major
change.
.
CXRs over the course of admission showed slowly improving
pulmonary edema, no major focal consolidations were seen.
.
Renal US - no hydronephrosis, patent renal artery.

Brief Hospital Course:
# PUMP/Chronic systolic congestive heart failure:
Patient presented with presumed acute exacerbation of chronic
systolic heart, which has improved after ultrafiltration. [**Date Range **]
with EF of 30-40% unchanged from prior. She currently appears
fairly euvolemic, however her fluid status has remained
difficult to manage given her low ejection fraction and poor
urine output.
- Continued home doses of carvedilol and losartan.  Were held
initially for low blood pressures, but both restarted during her
admission.
- Hemodialysis was considered for fluid managment, but a trial
of lasix proved successful.  She will now go home on 160 mg PO
daily lasix and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**], her nephrologist.
She will monitor daily weights/low sodium diet, pt had nutrition
consult during stay.
.
# CAD: No evidence ACS during hospitalization. Patient is s/p
recent LCx stent.  She was continued on ASA, carvedilol, plavix,
and Losartan.

.
#. Valves. No active issues. Severe AS a/p valvuloplasty
[**2174-5-11**], stable AS per [**Month/Day/Year **]. Discussed with patient and family:
per their report, patient was previously evaluated by Dr.
[**Name (NI) 137**] in cardiac surgery and was not a candidate for valve
replacment due to ""calcifications."" Patient may be candidate for
new cath-assisted valve replacement. Also has mild MR on last
[**Name (NI) 113**].  Pt should likely be re-evaluated after discharge.
.
# Respiratory distress resolved -
Respiratory distress was suspected to be likely multifactorial
secondary to volume overload and also PNA as supported by
elevated WBC on presentation, fever, and now GNR in sputum gram
stain but not growing on culture. Increased sputum overnight
while afebrile, non-elevated white count likely represents
resolving infection. Received monotherapy with ceftazadime only
given GNR in sputum may be pseudomonas; antibiotics started
[**5-29**], continued for 7 days.  She will continue lasix as
outpatient to try and prevent pulm edema.
.
# ANEMIA/GIB:
HCT drop was noted several two days into admission, unclear if
represented true blood loss. NGT removed [**5-31**] and this
demonstrated frank dark blood (+hemoccult) in NGT, likely
representing bleed several days ago from gastritis. LDH and
haptoglobin were checked with HCT drop and were within normal
limits which is inconsistent with hemolysis. She received 1 u
PRBCs soon after admission, and HCT has remained stable since.
Her Hcts were between 26 and 28.  Stools were checked for guiac,
and were positive two days prior to dicharge.  We discharged her
home with protonix and recommend follow up with her PCP to
continue to monitor CBCs for watch for blood loss.  She is not
actively losing blood as seen by her stable Hcts.  We also
recommend an outpatient colonoscopy.  Although, she needs to be
very careful with the bowel prep, as that can cause large fluid
shifts and drive her into pulmonary edema.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure (stable Cr):
Acute on chronic renal failure likely due to ATN secondary to
hypotension versus ongoing pre-renal state. Patient had been
initiated on HD in [**2174-3-15**]; was taken off HD ~1 week prior to

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Diagnoses:
1. Respiratory Failure
2. CHF
3. Renal Failure

Secondary Diagnoses:
1. Aortic Stenosis
2. Anemia
3. HTN


Discharge Condition:
Stable, afebrile, pt walking with a walker, eating on her own,
with a normal mental status.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for respiratory distress due to fluid in your
lungs from an acute episode of worsening heart failure.  You
were intubated at the time, and when you were able to breath on
your own, we continued to remove fluid from your lungs with
diuretics.  We also are continuing to give you the medicines
carvedilol and losartan for your heart failure.

You also will start taking lasix daily to ensure fluid stays off
your lungs.

In addition, you had acute renal failure during this admission.
Your kidney function improved, but you will continue to need
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**].  You also have a dialysis catheter in
your chest that will need to be taken care of by a home nurse.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**] will discuss removal of the catheter as an
outpatient.

We also found a trace amount of blood in your stool.  You should
meet with your PCP and discuss having a colonoscopy.  Make sure
to tell them you have heart failure because it does affect the
bowel preparation they plan for you.

Once at home, weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight >
3 lbs.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet.  Call the nutritionist with any
questions.

Also, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest
pain, dizziness or fainting or any other worrisome symptoms, do
not hesitate to call your doctor or call 911 in case of
emergency.

"Admission Date:  [**2188-11-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**2188-11-8**]


Service:  Medicine [**Hospital1 139**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
female who has a past medical history significant for
coronary artery disease, hypertension, dementia, recurrent
pneumonia and recent gastrectomy for peptic ulcer disease,
who presented to the emergency room with a complaint of
increasing shortness of breath.  The patient had been at home
for approximately 2 days following discharge from rehab
following gastrectomy when shortness of breath developed.
Emergency medical services were called and the patient was
found to have an oxygen saturation of 65% on room air and 85%
on 100% non-re-breather.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypothyroid.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Peptic ulcer disease status post gastrectomy for
perforated ulcer.
5.  Dementia.
6.  Esophageal motility disorder.
7.  Recurrent pneumonia.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Living situation - the patient at baseline
resides at home with 24 hour home health assistance.  There
is extensive family involvement.  The patient's code status
is DNR, DNI.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aricept 10 mg.
2.  Lasix 40 mg.
3.  Prevacid 30 mg.
4.  Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d.
5.  Multi-vitamin.
6.  Effexor 70 mg.
7.  Prednisone 25 mg.
8.  Zofran p.r.n.
9.  Synthroid 15 mg.

EXAM:  On presentation to the emergency department the
patient was found to have vital signs as follows:
Temperature 98.7, heart rate 82, blood pressure 160/62,
respiratory rate 25, oxygen saturation 87% on room air.  In
general, the patient is a well nourished but thin female in
respiratory distress.  There was no jugular venous distention
on examination of the neck.  Lung exam revealed decreased
breath sounds bilaterally.  Cardiovascular exam was
unremarkable.  The PEG site was clean, dry and intact.  The
patient was alert and oriented only to person.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  Admission CBC was unremarkable.
Admission SMA-7 was significant for an elevated BUN to
creatinine ratio consistent with dehydration.  Urinalysis was
unremarkable.  Cardiac enzymes were significant for an
isolated elevated troponin.  Coagulation studies were
unremarkable.  Arterial blood gas on 100% oxygen was
significant for a decreased pO2 of 70 and an elevated pCO2 of
59 with a normal pH.

RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray on admission revealed mild congestive
heart failure, markedly improved since the prior study of
[**2188-8-17**].  There was also bilateral lower lobe
opacification concerning for pneumonia.  CT angiogram
revealed consolidations at both lung bases consistent with
bibasilar pneumonia as well as subtle patchy opacifications
in the upper lobes with air fluid levels in the esophagus
suggesting possible aspiration.  There was no evidence of
pulmonary embolism.

CARDIAC STUDIES:  EKG on admission revealed sinus rhythm with
mild left axis deviation.  There was also felt to be possible
left anterior fascicular block.  The admitting MICU team
noted possible ST elevations in V3 through V6.
Echocardiogram revealed mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal left ventricular cavity size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function was normal.  There
was normal right ventricular systolic function.  There was
also moderate aortic regurgitation.  No pericardial effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Respiratory distress:  On admission, the patient was felt
to have bilateral pneumonia, most likely secondary to
aspiration.  The patient was started on IV Levaquin, Flagyl
and Vancomycin to cover for likely aspiration in a setting of
recent nursing home admission.  The patient was kept on
supplemental oxygen to keep oxygen saturations above 92% and
was kept NPO on aspirations precautions.  On day of admission
antibiotics were changed to IV ceftazidine, Flagyl and
Vancomycin.  Vancomycin was dosed at 1 gram q24 hours in the
setting of patient's decreased renal function, age and body
size.  On day two of admission the patient was also felt to
be fluid over loaded and gentle diuresis was resumed.  On day
two of admission the patient was felt to be stable for
transfer to the floor.  On the floor, the patient was
initially continued on IV antibiotics.  On day five of
admission the patient had a follow up chest x-ray which
revealed marked improvement in bibasilar pneumonia.  The
patient also had improvement in oxygen saturation and was
able to tolerate room air.  As a result, the patient was
transitioned to p.o. antibiotics and was given Augmentin and
Flagyl through the PEG tube.  The patient was discharged home
on hospital day 9 with instructions to complete a 14 day
course of p.o. antibiotics for presumed aspiration pneumonia.

2.  Cardiovascular:  Elevated troponin as well as possible ST
elevations on admission were felt to reflect a demand
ischemia.  Cardiac enzymes and EKG changes stabilized.  The
patient was continued on aspirin, Lopressor throughout the
admission.  On day three of admission the patient had an
episode of sinus tachycardia likely secondary to dehydration
versus multi-focal atrial tachycardia secondary to pulmonary
disease.  This resolved following hydration.  The patient's
cardiovascular function remained stable for the rest of the
admission.

3.  Dementia:  The patient was continued on Aricept
throughout the admission.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  Following rehydration, the patient was
found to have a mildly decreased hematocrit.  As a result,
the patient was received an elevation by gastroenterology to
look for gastrointestinal bleeding as an etiology of
decreased hematocrit.  Given the patient's history of peptic
ulcer disease, gastroenterology service recommended H. pylori
serology, which was negative.  Iron studies were sent, which
revealed a decreased total iron binding capacity as well as
decreased iron suggestive of a combination of both blood loss
and chronic disease as etiologies of anemia.
Gastroenterology service felt, however, that EGD and
colonoscopy were not an option in setting of patient's recent
ischemic cardiac disease.  Furthermore, the patient refused
gastroenterology work up.  Gastroenterology service also
asked to evaluate patient for possible contribution of reflux
of jejunostomy tube feedings to development of aspiration
pneumonia.  Gastroenterology service felt that reflux of
J-tube feedings was unlikely, however, felt that patient's
long history of esophageal dysmotility could be contributing
to aspiration.  They recommended swallowing study.  The
patient received an oropharyngeal video fluoroscopic
swallowing evaluation on day five of admission.  This
revealed mild oral with moderate to severe pharyngoesophageal
dysphagia with significant impaired upper esophageal
sphincter opening leading to severe residue of solids in the
pharynx.  However, there was no aspiration.  Nevertheless,
swallowing service recommended the patient in future have
only thin liquids, pureed solids or very finely/minced meat
in p.o. diet.  They also recommended that the patient sit
bolt upright at meals and for 45 minutes after meals.  They
recommended the patient remain at 45 degrees in bed at all
times and should never lay flat in bed and recommended that
if patient must remain flat in bed that tube feedings be
discontinued for 30 minutes prior to patient laying flat in
bed.

5.  Endocrine:  The patient was continued on Levothyroxine
for hypothyroidism.

6.  GU:  The patient was placed on Foley catheter on
admission to the hospital.  On day seven of admission the
patient was ready for discharge from a medical standpoint,
but did not void in time status post discontinuation of the
Foley catheter.  As a result the patient remained in-house
for an additional day to ensure the patient could void
spontaneously following discontinuation of Foley catheter.

POST DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Metronidazole 500 mg q8 hours x7
days, Augmentin 500/125 mg p.o. b.i.d. x7 days, furosemide 40
mg p.o. q.d., aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., metoprolol 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Venlafaxine HCL 75 mg capsule p.o. q.d.,
Levothyroxine 150 mcg p.o. q.d., donepezile hydrochloride 10
mg p.o. q.h.s., Lansoprazole 30 mg q.d., iron sulfate 325 mg
p.o. q.d., multi-vitamin.

DISPOSITION:  To home with visiting nurse as well as 24 hour
home health assistance.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  On day of discharge, the patient was
ambulating, voiding spontaneously and had oxygen saturation
of 97% on two liters.  The patient was demented in a manner
consistent with baseline.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Aspiration pneumonia.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Peptic ulcer disease status post gastrectomy.
5.  Hypothyroidism.
6.  Dementia.
7.  Esophageal dysmotility.
8.  Dehydration.

CODE STATUS:  DNR and DNI.

of substernal chest pain at 5 am. Pain was severe, and his first
thought was that he was having an MI. Pain unrelieved with
attempt at bowel movement. He denies fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, or any other symptoms. No radiation of the pain.

Cardiac work-up at OSH was negative, however abdominal CT showed
pneumoperitoneum. Pain was relieved with dilaudid 4 hrs ago. He
currently denies abdominal pain and feels much better.

[**2119-5-16**] Upper GI : In this patient status post gastric bypass and
partial gastrectomy with repair
of marginal ulcer, there is free flow of contrast through the
gastric pouch and the gastrojejunostomy. No leak or holdup of
contrast identified in this study.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 303**] was admitted to the hospital and examined by the
Bariatric service. He had no abdominal pain but had Dilaudid
prior to his transfer.  His cardiac work up was negative and due
to the finding of pneumoperitoneum on abd CT he was taken to the
Operating Room for an exploratory laparotomy. He had a
perforated marginal ulcer and underwent a partial gastrectomy,
omental patch to ulcer and a cholecystectomy. He tolerated the
procedure well and returned to the ICU in stable condition.
His pain was controlled with a Dilaudid PCA and he remained
hemodynamically stable.
He was subsequently transferred to the Surgical floor for
further management.

Due to his recent surgery and length of time prior to taking
fluids he had a PICC line placed for TPN which began on [**2119-5-14**]
through a right AC PICC line.  This was continued until [**2119-5-18**].
In the interim he had an upper GI on [**2119-5-16**] which showed no
anastomotic leak and he gradually began a stage 1 diet.  This
was slowly advanced over the next 24 hours to stage 3 and he had
no trouble with nausea or fullness.

His abdominal wound was healing well and he was up and walking
independently.  He remained free of any pulmonary complications
post op by using his incentive spirometer.  Roxicet was
effective in treating his incisional pain and he was generally
improving every day.

After an uncomplicated course he was discharged to home on
[**2119-5-18**] and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks.

IMAGING:
CT SCAN [**9-7**]
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Dependent atelectases are
present within
the lung bases bilaterally. There is no pleural effusion.
Visualized heart
and pericardium are unremarkable.

There is a striated appearance of bilateral kidneys, with
peripheral wedge- shaped hypodensities bilaterally. The largest
of these hypodensities is in the upper pole of the left kidney.
There is associated marked inflammatory stranding surrounding
both kidneys. Additionally, contrast is seen to excrete normally
from both kidneys. However, there is circumferential wall
thickening involving both ureters throughout its course. These
findings are overall suggestive of bilateral pyelonephritis,
with associated ureteritis. Although no discrete abscess is
identified, the hypodensity in the upper pole of the left
kidney, is likely at risk for developing an internal abscess.

The liver and gallbladder are within normal limits, with a focal
hypodensity adjacent to the gallbladder, may reflect an area of
focal fat. Spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are
unremarkable.

The stomach, small bowel, and large bowel are unremarkable. The
appendix is not definitively visualized, without secondary
findings to suggest acute appendicitis.

There is no free fluid or free air. Scattered retroperitoneal
nodes are seen, not meeting CT size criteria for pathologic
enlargement.

Urinary bladder, rectum are unremarkable. There is no pelvic
lymphadenopathy or free fluid.
IMPRESSION:
Findings most compatible with bilateral pyelonephritis and
ureteritis.
Although no discrete abscess is identified, a hypodensity within
the left
upper pole is seen, which may be at risk for developing into an
abscess. Close interval followup is suggested.


Brief Hospital Course:
60 yo female with hx of chronic hepatitis C infection (without
cirrhosis) presenting to the ED with 4 day hx of dysuria, chills
and found to have a grossly positive U/A with evidence of
bilateral pyelonephritis on CT Abd/pelvis who became hypotensive
to 80/30.
.
# Pyelonephritis/Sepsis: Pt w/ signs and sx of UTI for several
days; most likely with ascending GU infection. The patient has
no recent UTIs or hx of resistent organisms. The patient
presented to the ICU in stable condition.  CT scan of was
performed and consistent with pyelonephritis w/ no discrete
abscess, but showed a hypodensity that could represent possible
developing abscess in the left upper pole. She receieved cipro
in the ED prior to coming to the ICU and prior to blood
cultures.  The patient's blood pressures continued to range SBP
70-90's, but the patient had good mentation, urine output,
peripheral perfusion, and no compliants indication adequate end
organ perfusion.  Pt remains hypotensive (SBP 80-90) even after
receiving 7L of IVFs, but likely was dehydrated prior to
presentation and has high insensible losses due to fever.  Pt
also reports a ""low"" blood pressure at baseline. The patient was
also given one dose of stress dose steriods, but was
discontinued in the AM after her random cortisol was 32.  The
patient was continued on IV ciprofloxacin and and was
transitioned to po cipro 500mg Q12 x 14 day course.  The
patient's urine grew E. Coli and sensitivities were pending.
The patient's blood pressure ranged between SBP 90-110 on
discharge.  Pt was afebrile, ambulating, eating po, and feeling
back to her baseline.
.
# Acute renal failure: The patient initial creatine was 1.1 and
stablized to 1.0 today.  Her baseline is around 0.7. This is
likely prerenal w/ combination of poor po intake, vomiting,
fever.
.
# Chronic hepatitis C infection: Stable, has not required
treatment.  LFT's were wnl.

PCP:
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient should have a CBC and BP check tomorrow.  The
patient was hypotensive in ICU (not pressor dependent), but was
back to her baseline blood pressure at discharge and afebrile.
The patient's urine culture is growing E. Coli, but
sensitivities are not back.  Please call the ICU ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 506**])
to follow-up on sensitivies.  Additionally, the patient's CT
scan showed a hypodensity within the left upper pole, which may
be at risk for developing into an abscess. Close interval
followup is suggested. Imaging should be repeated if symptoms
worsen or recurrs after treatment.  The patient should be
continued for a 14 day course of antibiotics.

Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BiPAP


History of Present Illness:
84M PMhx metastatic papillary thyroid CA (s/p resection,
radioactive iodine) c/b lung mets, found to have large cavitary
mass in RLL, recent admission with malignant effusion + for SCC
recently treated for presumed post-obstructive pna.  Prior
hospitalization was also notable for PET scan that revealed
widely metastatic disease.

He presents today from rehab with acute respiratory distress.
Pt is [**Name (NI) 595**] speaking so history was obtained from family.  At
baseline he is on 2L o2, yesterday he was doing well, but last
night he woke up in respiratory distress.  The rehab reported
that he was sating at 80% on a non-rebreather mask.  EMS was
called and he was transferred the the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  Prior to event,
pt denies any fevers or chills, nausea, vomiting.  He has a
chronic cough secondary to his lung ca but the quality of the
cough did not change.  he is not experiencing any pain.

Of note, pt's recent PMH is notable for rapid progression of
metastatic lung SCC.  He started experiencing chronic cough and
hemoptysis in [**Month (only) 547**] and symptoms have progressed since.  In [**Month (only) 596**]
he was noted to have a large cavitary mass in RLL with satellite
nodules suggestive of primary lung Ca.

At the end of [**Month (only) **] he was admitted to osh with fever,
leukocytosis and cough and treated with ctx.  His  symptoms did
not improve.  At this time a CT showed cavitary lesion as above
and a new large r exudative pleural effusion.  Effusion
reaccumulated resulting in supplemental O2 requirement.  As such
a chest tube was placed and the cytology came back + for SCC.
He was started on vanc zosyn for obstructive pna and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  Hospital course was notable for r/o PE,
attempted pleurx catheter placement on [**6-27**] that failed due to
loculated effusions not amenable to pleurx.  At this point a PET
scan was done that showed extensive metastatic dz.

In the ED, initial VS were: t 98.1 80 106/46 80s on [**Last Name (LF) 597**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he
was started on bipap 60 15/5 and his sats improved to 96%.  He
was noted to have bilaterally crackles throughout lung fields,
and a power picc was in place in right ac fossa.

CXR is consistent with prior xrays from earlier this month, but
RLL effusion appears to have expanded.  Labs were notable for
wbc of 38k with 94% N,  hct was 25 and platelets 504.  He was
given vanc and cefepine and transferred to the unit.

On arrival to the MICU, pt is somnolent, on bipap and sating in
the low 90s.  he is with his family and easily arousable.  He is
answering questions appropriately.  His family was concerned
that he has been over sedated since he last left [**Hospital1 18**].  The
report that he has been sleeping all day and are concerned that
he is receiving too much narcotics.  Apparently he was recently
started on a fentanyl patch 50mcg at rehab.

Brief Hospital Course:
84M history of metastatic papillary thyroid cancer (s/p
resection, radioactive iodine) complicated by lung metastases,
found to have large cavitary mass in RLL with recent admission
for malignant effusion positive for small cell lung cancer
recently treated for presumed post-obstructive pna that presents
with acute respiratory distress. His respiratory distress was
thought to be secondary to aforementioned metastatic disease. It
was discussed with family and patient that his disease was
terminal without many further options. He was stabilized on
biPAP. Goals of care discussion yielded to make the patient
comfort measures only. He expired at 11:55 AM on [**2118-7-11**] with
family at the bedside including his wife and son. [**Name (NI) 6**] autopsy was
declined. Given death was within 24 hours of admission, the
medical examiner was notified but declined the case for further
review. The etiology of death was respiratory distress from lung
cancer.

hypercarbic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation [**2101-11-1**]
A line insertion [**2101-11-2**]
PICC line [**2101-11-2**]

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F w/hx of COPD on 2L at baseline for last day has had increase
O2 requirement. Per husband/rehab has increased O2 requirement
over the last day. Coughing decreased from COPD baseline. Yest
was hypoxic and NC uptitrated to 5L. This AM requiring NRB (sats
and circumstances unclear). [**Name2 (NI) **] has been afebrile but has
had increasing LE edema.

Per husbands report, had not been on home O2 for COPD until
placed in rehab in [**Month (only) 205**]. Had been living at home and very
functional until recent admission in [**Month (only) 205**] for N/V/Abd
distension. Had a laparotomy and appendix taken and out R
femoral hernia repaired. D/ced to rehab and has been there
since. Husband reports that roughly a week ago she had a
worsening cough and he thought she had developed bronchitis.
From the rehab charts it appears she was put on a prednisone
taper and azithromycin. He reports she had been improving with
these treatments until the last 2 days, although his history of
her worsening is very unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] ED signout from talking to
the nursing home she was more hypoxic yesterday requiring 5L NC
and being placed on a NRB this AM. He reports she was
complaining of no other symptoms but is unclear if there was any
change in her mental status.

He reports that at home baseline before rehab she was able to
talk roughly 50yds before being limited by shortness of breath.
She did all the chores, cooking, and cleaning at the house per
his report and they went out together 3x/week. Since her
admission to the hospital and discharge to rehab, he reports she
had not done as well, but again his history is somewhat unclear.

ED Course, presented with Temp 98.4, HR 96, BP 118/54, RR 44,
Sats 100% on NRB. Altered here, A&O x 1, husband (also in 90s)
says she is fine at rehab baseline. Rales bilateral bases with
JVD at mandible. CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions with
infiltrated on RLQ and concern for aspiration. WBC elevated to
17.3 (89% PMNs without bands, Bcx drawn, and started on
vanco/zosyn. EKG: NSR at 94, NA/NI, No ST elevations. Given
combivent trial with 125mg IV methlyprednisone. Initial Chem 7
with HCO3 of 42, BNP of 1700. Initial VBG on NRB showed 7.23 /
112 / 55 / 49. Trialed on BiPAP with ABG showing 7.18 / 138 /
209 / 54. Pt wasn't tolerating BiPAP and kept taking off. Resp
rate high but other VSS. ED called PCP and daughter as pt had
DNR order but no DNI order and husband wanting everything done.
Daughter and PCP decided to intubate and see how things go with
thought that would withdraw care if dosen't recover. Easy
intubation. Intubated with succinylcholine and propofol. After
intubation and propofol BPs dropped to 80s/60s, given 1L NS and
switched to Midazolam and Fentanyl. Did not require pressors and
BPs came up to 110-120s. No CVL placed (2 PIV). Yellowish fluid
from lungs after intubation (unclear when was aspirating - with
intubation vs yest).

VS on ICU arrival now: Afebrile, BP 106/51, HR 81, RR 20, 98% on
100% FiO2 on Vent. Pt unable to respond to questioning and so no
ROS could be obtained.

IMAGING:
[**2101-11-1**] CXR
IMPRESSION: Limited study. Small bilateral pleural effusions
with patchy
opacities in the lung bases, which are nonspecific, and may
reflect
aspiration, infection, or atelectasis.

[**2101-11-2**] CXR
Evaluation of the study is limited due to technique, also the
patient's chin obscures the apices of the lungs. Allowing this
limitation, the ET tube is against the right tracheal wall. NG
tube is in the stomach. Cardiomegaly is stable. Bilateral
pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis have increased. The
upper lungs are hyperinflated.

[**2101-11-2**] CXR
Comparison to prior chest radiograph for PICC line is now seen
up until the subclavian on the right vein on the right side is
not seen any further than that point. The rest of the chest
radiograph is unchanged from prior and extremely difficult to
interpret secondary to patient positioning.

[**2101-11-2**] CXR
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-1**] and 28:
Right PIC line passes into the right neck, where the tip
position is unclear, but at least 4 cm above the thoracic inlet.

Nasogastric tube passes to the distal stomach and out of view.
Heart size is top normal. Small bilateral pleural effusions have
improved since earlier in the day, but there is no suggestion of
new consolidation at the right lung base which could be
pneumonia and warrants careful followup.

[**2101-11-3**] CXR
FINDINGS: Exam is limited by kyphotic positioning of the
patient, resulting in obscuration of the lung apices and
superior mediastinum. Endotracheal tube remains in place with
tip at approximately the thoracic inlet level. Nasogastric tube
courses below the diaphragm. Cardiomediastinal contours are
unchanged in appearance. Persistent bibasilar opacities, likely
a combination of pleural effusions and provided history of
aspiration pneumonia. Tip of right PICC has been withdrawn and
now terminates in the right axilla.

[**2101-11-5**] CXR
AP chest radiograph:
The study is suboptimal given the rotated position of the
patient and his neck being in extreme flexion and the head
overlying the lung apices. Within those limitations, the ET tube
tip appears to be close to the carina, approximately 1 cm above
it and reposition might be considered.
The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm, most likely
terminating in the
stomach. Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis
is
redemonstrated.

[**2101-11-9**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-5**], the
head of the patient greatly obscures the upper lungs.
Endotracheal tube is not definitely seen.
Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral
effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. Central catheter from the
right appears to extend to at least the lower portion of the
right atrium.

[**2101-11-10**] CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph,
there is no relevant
change. Technically problem[**Name (NI) 115**] examination. Evidence of
moderate
cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis and small bilateral
pleural
effusions. Unchanged position of the right PICC line.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F with severe underlying COPD admitted with hypercarbic
respiratory failure due to pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. Her
course was notable for MICU admission requiring intubation and
succesful extubation. Her floor course was c/b heart failure,
metabolic disarray, and persistent high oxygen requirement and
work of breathing. The patient elected to make her code status
DNR/DNI/No NIPPV and unfortunately her respiratory function
continued to deteriorate over her hospitalization and she
ultimately passed away.

#Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/COPD/Pneumonia/Acute-on-chronic
diastolic heart failure/Hypernatremia:
Patient was admitted to the MICU after intubation in the ED for
hypercarbic respiratory failure that did not improve with NIPPV.
She was felt to have pneumonia on top of a severe COPD
exacerbation and was initially treated broadly with Vancomycin,
Levaquin, and Cefepime as well as steroids and bronchodilators.
Her antibiotics were narrowed to Levaquin and the patient was
able to be extubated. She was also diuresed with improvement in
her symptoms. She was extubated and transferred to the floor but
had persistent oxygen requirement requiring 50% O2 by face mask
to maintain oxygen saturation in the low 90s. She was noted to
be volume overloaded but diuresis was complicated by
hypernatremia requiring intermittent free water repletion and
hypokalemia with runs of NSVT on telemetry and paroxysms of
atrial tachycardia to the 150s. She was maintained on
levofloxacin and steroids, given morphine as needed for symptoms
of dyspnea, and diuresed but did not improve.  Over the last 3
days of her hospitalization she slowly declined with worsening
respiratory status, increased work of breathing, and more
frequent episodes of somnolence and confusion.

#Goals of care:
Given the severity of both acute and underlying illness,
Palliative care was consulted and the overall poor outlook was
discussed with the patient, her husband, and her children. The
patient expressed that she did not want CPR or intubation and
did not want non-invasive ventilation. On [**2101-11-10**] AM the patient
had significant respiratory distress marked by tachypnea,
altered mental status, and evidence of volume overload on exam.
She was diuresed and given more aggressive nebulizers and her
antibiotics were expanded, but she continued to decline and
ultimately passed away on the morning of [**2101-11-10**]. Her family and
PCP were notified.
